# SpaceX ISS Simulator (Lucas's mod)

Run the [SpaceX ISS Docking Simulator](https://iss-sim.spacex.com/) locally.

Modifications:

- Timer
- Key aliases:
  - IK/JL/UP keys for rotations
  - `2`/`9` keys for toggles
  - `[`/`]` as aliases for backward/forward
- Very fake sound effects

## Run

```shell
make dev # uses Caddy
# Open localhost:1998
```
